      <description>how it feels to collect you:
(I have been trying to reframe some of my language from &amp;ldquo;archiving&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;collecting,&amp;rdquo; as I believe that it is more accurate. Archiving implies a method of organization and an attention to certain information that I am currently disregarding.)
like a betrayal of your current self, the you who is not reading this right now, the &amp;ldquo;future you&amp;rdquo; to whom you wrote as a despairing high school sophomore like re-committing my love to you, both in the past and in the present like delaying our reunion.</description>
