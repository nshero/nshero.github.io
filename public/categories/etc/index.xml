      <description>Now when I think of making something new I also think about having to preserve it. Might as well get it saved away ahead of time so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to yank its guts out of another wayback scrape.

What is worth keeping? What is okay to throw away? Despite a year and a half of ferreting around, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to any answer at all.</description>
