      <description>Here are two elusive things.
In 1996-1997, I was taught a primary-level cross-disciplinary curriculum for &amp;ldquo;gifted&amp;rdquo; (cringe) students in a small pull-out program. The curriculum implements a frame story that may involve several children traveling to a distant land (it may have been another country, or perhaps an imaginary dimension) and meeting a girl named Zara who wore a Claddagh ring.

      <description>Now when I think of making something new I also think about having to preserve it. Might as well get it saved away ahead of time so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to yank its guts out of another wayback scrape.
It adds an extra weight to whatever I start, which is a hindrance.
What is worth keeping? What is okay to throw away? Despite a year and a half of ferreting around, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to any answer at all.</description>
