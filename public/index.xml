      <description>I was overwhelmed by the archive project, burrowing deeper and deeper without any sense of progress or perspective. I wondered: Is this whole garbage barge (GARBARGE??) moving at all? Is this accomplishing my goals? How will I know if it is or is not? What is the &amp;lsquo;goal&amp;rsquo; of a project that feels like an endless, unchartered sea? If I keep on this route how will I ever finish anything? I needed to re-find the center, or whatever felt like the closest thing to the squelchy heart of the whole endeavor.</description>

      <description>I hated talking on the phone, and really the only people who called me were my parents (and spammers). So they went to voicemail. Constantly. After years of having a mother who would, on some occasions, call me upwards of four times a day, I had finally tried to set a few boundaries. Then I let them grow taller and taller. When I resolved to stop answering so many phone calls, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell if their need was increasing or if my desire for freedom and self-determination was growing, or both.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally gotten around to tagging all of my old journal entries, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little more trying than I anticipated. Firstly, because I have not been very efficient. I say &amp;ldquo;efficient&amp;rdquo; less in terms of productivity and more in terms of wheel-spinning. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a &amp;ldquo;theme&amp;rdquo; of my work to take the long way round, to over-stress and over-work myself over nothing. To spend hours upon hours hunched over a tiny detail until it becomes unrecognizable but the piece as a whole has remained a stranger in the next room the whole time.</description>

      <description>how it feels to collect you:
(I have been trying to reframe some of my language from &amp;ldquo;archiving&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;collecting,&amp;rdquo; as I believe that it is more accurate. Archiving implies a method of organization and an attention to certain information that I am currently disregarding.)
like a betrayal of your current self, the you who is not reading this right now, the &amp;ldquo;future you&amp;rdquo; to whom you wrote as a despairing high school sophomore like re-committing my love to you, both in the past and in the present like delaying our reunion.</description>

      <description>Here are two elusive things.
In 1996-1997, I was taught a primary-level cross-disciplinary curriculum for &amp;ldquo;gifted&amp;rdquo; (cringe) students in a small pull-out program. The curriculum implements a frame story that may involve several children traveling to a distant land (it may have been another country, or perhaps an imaginary dimension) and meeting a girl named Zara who wore a Claddagh ring. The program included an audio-cassette reading of the story and several accompanying songs, which may have centered around common aphorisms like &amp;ldquo;look before you leap.</description>

      <description>Now when I think of making something new I also think about having to preserve it. Might as well get it saved away ahead of time so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to yank its guts out of another wayback scrape.
It adds an extra weight to whatever I start, which is a hindrance.
What is worth keeping? What is okay to throw away? Despite a year and a half of ferreting around, I haven&amp;rsquo;t come to any answer at all.</description>
