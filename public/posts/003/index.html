    <p>how it feels to collect you:</p>
<p><em>(I have been trying to reframe some of my language from &ldquo;archiving&rdquo; to &ldquo;collecting,&rdquo; as I believe that it is more accurate. Archiving implies a method of organization and an attention to certain information that I am currently disregarding.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>like a betrayal of your current self, the you who is not reading this right now, the &ldquo;future you&rdquo; to whom you wrote as a despairing high school sophomore</li>
<li>like re-committing my love to you, both in the past and in the present</li>
<li>like delaying our reunion. It feels like keeping a secret from you, that I love(d) you so fiercely that I want to bring you with me to my imaginary escape hatch. In some cases it means that I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable reaching out to you in the present until I finish <del>archiving</del> collecting your past.</li>
<li>like saying goodbye to you again, like mourning your absence, like the pain of remembering how much I missed you and how we were supposed to escape together</li>
<li>like watching a thousand versions of all of the things I have missed in the interim &ndash; your weddings; the births of your children; your master&rsquo;s degrees; your divorces; the deaths of your parents</li>
<li>like trying to understand that sometimes people are in one&rsquo;s life for a particular amount of time, and you move past one another and diverge</li>
</ul>
<p>My partner is mystified as to why I won&rsquo;t automate this process. By now surely I would have found an easier way so save your entries that can also keep me from another IP-ban. Despite the fact that a program is smarter and automatically more thorough than I could ever be, more complete in every way, and also significantly faster, there is something that <em>feels</em> more complete and more secure to do it myself. I want to know that I have opened your monthly archives, manually saving your single entries in folders.</p>
<p>Most of the time I skim lightly over your entries, avoiding reading them in order to save time and keep my momentum. I look for links or reasons to come back for a more careful review, then I save the file under its six-digit number, close out of it, and move on. Even then, I am catching enough to follow onto the contours of your life at the time. Besides, even in the situations where I am just running a command to pull from the Internet Archive, I can&rsquo;t help but take the time to expand all of your snapshots, to spend a few hours piecing your past together and remembering&ndash; our time together; our time apart.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll always wish for more. Ever the neurotic completionist, I can never find enough of you for my repository.</p>
